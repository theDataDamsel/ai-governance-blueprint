# AI Governance Blueprint

A practical collection of frameworks, policies, process maps and control libraries for governing AI, ML and GenAI systems in enterprise and regulated environments.

Most AI governance guidance is either too abstract or too technical. This blueprint aims to bridge that gap with structures that executives, risk teams, legal, IT and data teams can all understand and use.
